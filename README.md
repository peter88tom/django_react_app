In this project will build a To-Do application using Django and React.

For this application, React serves as frontend, or client-side framework, handling the user interface and getting and setting the data via request to the Django backend, which is an APi build using Django Rest Framework(DRF).

# Deployment
I have deployed the back-end on **Railway** and Front-end on **Netlify**.
